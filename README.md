# backstopjs
Test tool for visual regression, to be installed to root of project you are testing. 

##Installation
See https://github.com/garris/BackstopJS

You will also need Casper and Phantom

 ```npm install -g casperjs```
 
 ```npm install -g casperjs```

The configuration is controlled by backstop.json.  I have commented the commands in this version.
